Problem Statement: Airlines face challenges in identifying high-demand routes, improving seat utilization, and reducing customer complaints. This project analyzes air cargo and passenger data to optimize operations and revenue.

Tables Used:

airports
airport_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
airport_name VARCHAR(100),
city VARCHAR(50),
country VARCHAR(50)

routes
route_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
source_airport INT,
destination_airport INT,
distance_km INT

flights
flight_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
route_id INT,
flight_date DATE,
capacity INT,
booked_seats INT

tickets
ticket_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
flight_id INT,
price DECIMAL(10,2),
booking_date DATE

complaints
complaint_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
flight_id INT,
complaint_type VARCHAR(50),
complaint_date DATE


1. Identify Busiest Routes
SELECT 
    r.route_id,
    a1.city AS source_city,
    a2.city AS destination_city,
    COUNT(f.flight_id) AS total_flights
FROM flights f
JOIN routes r ON f.route_id = r.route_id
JOIN airports a1 ON r.source_airport = a1.airport_id
JOIN airports a2 ON r.destination_airport = a2.airport_id
GROUP BY r.route_id, a1.city, a2.city
ORDER BY total_flights DESC
LIMIT 5;


Insight to mention:

Identified top 5 busiest routes contributing to majority of passenger traffic.

 2. Seat Utilization Analysis
SELECT
    flight_id,
    ROUND((booked_seats * 100.0 / capacity), 2) AS seat_utilization_pct
FROM flights;


Business Value:

Helped identify underperforming flights for consolidation or pricing changes.

 3. Revenue Analysis by Route
SELECT
    r.route_id,
    SUM(t.price) AS total_revenue
FROM tickets t
JOIN flights f ON t.flight_id = f.flight_id
JOIN routes r ON f.route_id = r.route_id
GROUP BY r.route_id
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;


Insight:

High-revenue routes were prioritized for increased flight frequency.

 4. Monthly Revenue Trend
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', booking_date) AS month,
    SUM(price) AS monthly_revenue
FROM tickets
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;


Impact to Say:

Enabled revenue forecasting and seasonal demand planning.

 5. Customer Complaint Analysis
SELECT
    complaint_type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_complaints
FROM complaints
GROUP BY complaint_type
ORDER BY total_complaints DESC;


Outcome:

Identified baggage delays and overbooking as top complaint drivers.

 6. Complaints vs Seat Utilization (Advanced Insight)
SELECT
    f.flight_id,
    ROUND((f.booked_seats * 100.0 / f.capacity), 2) AS utilization,
    COUNT(c.complaint_id) AS complaints
FROM flights f
LEFT JOIN complaints c ON f.flight_id = c.flight_id
GROUP BY f.flight_id, utilization
ORDER BY complaints DESC;


Story to Tell:

Overbooked flights showed higher complaint frequency → led to booking caps.
